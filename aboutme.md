title: About me
---

My name is William Frazier. I recently earned my MS in computer science with a specialization in computer security from Boston University. My Master's project and research focused on searching encrypted databases. I have a particular interest in Intel SGX, a broken yet exciting new way of computing. I received my Bachelor's in computer science from Middlebury College in 2019.
