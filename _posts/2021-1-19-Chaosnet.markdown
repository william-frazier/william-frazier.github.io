# Interesting Historical Note

It was a busy start to the week so I don't have my usual blog post done yet. Hopefully, I'll have it up tomorrow. In the meantime, check out this interesting [blog post](https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/30/chaosnet.html) I found. It's pretty short and well worth the read.
