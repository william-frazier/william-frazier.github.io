# Introduction

When I was in college, one of my Arabic classes had a rule for presenting where the only thing you were allowed to preface your presentation with was "standard disclaimer". That phrase was meant to sum up the usual things that people presenting say (e.g., "now some of this is a little rough" or "please excuse my pronunciation"). It was a way to conveniently convey all that information while taking less time. I found the standard disclaimer useful in college and I think there's a use for it here too as my blog begins to tackle more security-oriented topics.

# My Philosophy on Teaching Security

Computer security is a discipline where the details really, really matter. The specific implementation of a system can easily make or break the security. At the same time, I find that teaching every aspect of a system often causes people to lose the forest for the trees. I'm going to try to avoid that on my posts that touch on security. 

What I'm getting at is that when you see "standard disclaimer" in one of my posts, I am letting you know that I am trying to give the intuition for what is going on. It means I may be glossing over details. It might even mean I'm changing little details to make the discussion smoother (although I'll try to keep that minimal). If you really want to understand these systems, you're going to have to go read research papers and technical reports. This blog is only meant to give you an introduction.
